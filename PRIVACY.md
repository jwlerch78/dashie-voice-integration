# Privacy — what leaves your box, per mode

Chickadee's data posture depends entirely on which engines you point it at.
Three modes, three answers. Everything here is verifiable in this repo's
source.

## Local mode (your own engines, no account)

**Nothing leaves your network.** Speech goes to the STT/TTS/LLM endpoints
you configured (your Ollama box, your Whisper server), the brain runs in
the add-on, and no Chickadee service is contacted — there is no account,
no telemetry, no version ping.

## Bring-your-own-key

Audio and text go to **the providers you configured** (e.g. Google, OpenAI,
OpenRouter) under **your** API key, directly from your box. Chickadee's
servers are not involved. Your keys are stored on-box only
(`/data/api-keys.json`, file mode 600), are masked in the console UI, and
are excluded from HA backups (`backup_exclude`).

One credential this does **not** cover: the add-on↔integration bridge secret
is also mirrored to `<config>/.chickadee/bridge_secret`, which is in your HA
config directory and therefore **is** included in HA backups —
`backup_exclude` only reaches `/data`. It's a same-box credential (nothing is
exposed on your LAN), but while signed in it can be exchanged for your
household account token, so it's worth more than the name suggests. Details
and the reset in the add-on's DOCS → "How the bridge auth works".

## Chickadee Cloud (signed in)

When you leave an engine blank while signed in, that stage runs on hosted
engines under your account:

- **Sent per turn:** the audio (STT), the turn text + your Assist-exposed
  entity context (LLM), and the reply text (TTS). Context is scoped to
  what the question needs — Chickadee sends your exposed-entity states,
  not your whole HA config.
- **Stored for billing:** per-call usage rows — model, token counts,
  latency, cost. Metered credits require this; it's the invoice.
- **Transcripts:** stored **only** if you enable transcript retention /
  "share to improve" in the console (off by default). Without it, billing
  rows carry usage numbers, not your words.
- Accounts & billing run on the same backend as Dashie (see
  [PROVENANCE.md](PROVENANCE.md)). Account deletion is available in the
  console (Account → Danger Zone): billing stops immediately, data is
  purged after a 15-day grace window.

## Things this add-on never does, in any mode

- No analytics or tracking SDKs (no Google Analytics, Sentry, PostHog, …)
- No startup phone-home, no update checks, no version pings
- No listening: wake-word detection is your satellite's job; the add-on
  only receives audio HA's Assist pipeline hands it
- The **LAN engine scan** (console → Local Engines → Scan) runs only when
  you click it, probes private subnets only, uses read-only unauthenticated
  version-endpoint GETs to identify engines, and its results render in the
  console — they are never sent off-box
- One caveat for completeness: the **console page in your browser** loads
  three pinned open-source libraries (supabase-js, hls.js, heic2any) from
  the jsDelivr CDN — a standard static fetch by your browser, no data sent
  beyond the request itself. The voice pipeline never touches a CDN
- The add-on ↔ integration bridge is same-box only (`ports: {}` — nothing
  is exposed on your LAN), authenticated with a random per-install secret
