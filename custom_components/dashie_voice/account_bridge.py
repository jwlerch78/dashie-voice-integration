"""Account/sharing bridge — the LAN-sharing lane to the Dashie for Home Assistant add-on.

Ported from the Dashie integration's addon_bridge account helpers. The add-on
holds the household account JWT and the sharing opt-in; this module is the only
place the integration asks for them, and voice_view.py is the only consumer.

Semantics preserved from the Dashie lane (they are field-tested):
  - credential cache capped at 5 min so an account swap on the box can't vend
    the old JWT for days;
  - sharing re-checked (30s TTL) even on a credential cache hit, so a revoked
    toggle takes effect without waiting for JWT expiry;
  - everything fails CLOSED on sharing; voice-config fails to NO ANSWER ({}),
    leaving the route default to the build's brain seam rather than guessing
    a lane this build may not have.
