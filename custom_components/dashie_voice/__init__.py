"""Dashie Voice — an open voice pipeline for Home Assistant.

The integration is the Assist-pipeline surface: conversation + STT + TTS
entities. The Dashie for Home Assistant add-on is the brain and engine router: it owns which
model/engine each entity actually talks to, plus key custody and the console
UI. They meet at the bridge (addon_bridge.py; contract in CONTRACTS.md).
