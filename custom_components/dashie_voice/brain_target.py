"""WHERE the brain is — the one function that knows.

The gateway used to answer this three times over (`_cloud_base`, `_brain_url`,
`_stt_token_url` in voice_view.py), each reachable only by reading the function
above it. That is fine while there is one product. It stops being fine the moment
a second brand exists, because "where is the brain" is the thing that differs
between them — and a value that differs per brand, duplicated across call sites,
is the shape that breaks silently across a rename.

So this module owns the answer and nothing else. Deliberately NOT in
`addon_bridge`: `account_bridge` already imports `addon_bridge`, and this needs
both, so putting it there would be a cycle. It sits above both bridges, which is
also where it belongs conceptually.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO
---------------------
It does not POST. Callers still build their own request and handle their own
response, including the NDJSON streaming loop. That duplication is mechanical —
it does not rot across a rename — so consolidating it is a separate, larger
change that moves a shipped LAN-satellite path from "cloud with an account
credential" to "add-on that re-routes", and therefore owes an on-device run
before it can be called done. Tracked in the Dashie repo's build plan.

THE BRAND SEAM IS ONE CONSTANT
------------------------------
`_FALLBACK_CLOUD_BASE`. A build with an account cloud names it; a build without
one sets it to None, and the add-on becomes the brain — which is already the
stated architecture ("the add-on owns engine routing (cloud / BYOK / local) and
key custody", const.py). Nothing else in the gateway needs to know which brand it
is running as.
