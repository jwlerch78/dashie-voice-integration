"""Voice lane to the add-on — the calls that need no account.

Split out of `account_bridge.py`, which had grown two lanes with one name. It
described itself as "the LAN-sharing lane" while holding three functions that
have nothing to do with sharing: the add-on's own brain, its voice config, and a
BYOK Live token minted from a key the box already stores. None of them touch the
household account, the sharing opt-in, or the account JWT.

WHY THE SPLIT IS A FILE AND NOT A COMMENT
-----------------------------------------
A build with no account ships this module and NOT `account_bridge.py`. Making
the brand boundary a file boundary means the branded variant drops one path
instead of carving eight functions out of a shared file — and a carve is the
fragile kind of change: it is invisible to a residue scan, it re-breaks whenever
the source file is edited, and the generator's block-dropper has eaten
neighbouring code doing exactly this before.

So the rule for anything added here: if it needs `get_account_credential`, the
sharing gate, or the account JWT, it belongs in `account_bridge.py`, not here.
